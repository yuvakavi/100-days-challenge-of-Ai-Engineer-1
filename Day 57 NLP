# 🧾 Sample dataset

    "I love this movie, it was amazing!",
    "This film was terrible and boring.",
    "I enjoyed every moment of the movie.",
    "The plot was dull and acting was bad.",
    "Fantastic direction and great story!",
    "Worst movie I have ever seen."

# ✂️ Split data

# 🧮 Convert text to numbers

# 🤖 Train model

# 🔮 Predict
